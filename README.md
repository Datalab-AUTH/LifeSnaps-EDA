### LifeSnaps: a 4-month multi-modal dataset capturing unobtrusive snapshots of our lives in the wild

Ubiquitous self-tracking technologies have penetrated various aspects of our lives, from physical and mental health monitoring to fitness and entertainment. Yet, limited data exist on the association between in the wild large-scale physical activity patterns, sleep, stress, and overall health, and behavioral patterns and psychological measurements due to challenges in collecting and releasing such datasets, such as waning user engagement, privacy considerations, and diversity in data modalities. In this paper, we present the **LifeSnaps dataset**, a multi-modal, longitudinal, and geographically-distributed dataset, containing a plethora of anthropological data, collected unobtrusively for the total course of more than 4 months by $n=71$ participants, under the [European H2020 RAIS project](https://rais-itn.eu/). LifeSnaps contains more than 35 different data types from second to daily granularity, totaling more than 71M rows of data. The participants contributed their data through numerous validated surveys, real-time ecological momentary assessments, and a Fitbit Sense smartwatch, and consented to make these data available openly to empower future research. We envision that releasing this large-scale dataset of multi-modal real-world data, will open novel research opportunities and potential applications in the fields of medical digital innovations, data privacy and valorization, mental and physical well-being, psychology and behavioral sciences, machine learning, and human-computer interaction.
